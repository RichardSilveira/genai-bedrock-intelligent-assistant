# AnyTicket GenAI Chatbot ‚Äì AWS Bedrock & RAG (Production-Ready Portfolio)

Welcome to the **AnyTicket AI Support Assistant** project‚Äîa robust, production-grade Generative AI solution built on AWS Bedrock and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This project demonstrates advanced cloud architecture, secure infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and real-world GenAI application development for the event ticketing domain.

## üöÄ Executive Summary

- **Business Value:**
  - 24/7 intelligent customer support for event ticketing, reducing operational costs and improving customer satisfaction.
  - Secure, scalable, and compliant by design‚Äîready for real-world enterprise workloads.
- **Solution Highlights:**
  - Modern GenAI patterns, multi-turn conversation, and contextual Q&A from unstructured data.
  - End-to-end security, observability, and automation using AWS best practices.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Overview

- **Domain:** Event ticketing (AnyTicket)
- **Use Case:** AI-powered, multi-turn customer support chatbot
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS (Bedrock, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront, WAF, VPC, S3, IAM, etc.)
- **IaC:** 100% managed via Terraform (modular, reusable, and production-ready)
- **Frontend:** Minimal Streamlit demo for API showcase (decoupled from backend)

## üåü Key Differentiators

- **Production-Ready by Design:**
  - Security, scalability, and compliance are built-in‚Äînot afterthoughts.
  - Automated deployment, monitoring, and guardrails for safe GenAI adoption.
- **AWS Well-Architected Framework Alignment:**
  - [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) principles:
    - **Operational Excellence:** Logging and monitoring.
    - **Security:** WAF, API keys, IAM least privilege, Bedrock Guardrails, prompt injection protection.
    - **Reliability:** Multi-AZ VPC, reserved Lambda concurrency, API Gateway throttling.
    - **Performance Efficiency:** Serverless, auto-scaling, and global CDN (CloudFront).
    - **Cost Optimization:** Pay-as-you-go, no idle resources, and efficient resource sizing.
- **Real-World Patterns:**
  - Multi-turn conversation, session management, secure prompt engineering, and content safety.
  - Modular IaC for rapid adaptation to new domains or data sources.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance Highlights

- **Defense-in-Depth:**
  - AWS WAF, CloudFront, and API Gateway for layered protection.
  - Lambda authorizer for API key validation and origin verification.
  - Bedrock Guardrails for content safety and compliance.
- **Data Privacy:**
  - No PII leakage‚Äîprompt template and RAG output are strictly controlled.
  - All secrets managed via environment variables and SSM Parameter Store.
- **Audit & Observability:**
  - CloudWatch logging for API, Lambda, and WAF events.
  - Modular observability stack for production monitoring.
