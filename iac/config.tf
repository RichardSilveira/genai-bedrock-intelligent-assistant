# AWS Config - Security Monitoring
# --------------------------------------------------
# Notes on AWS Config architecture:
# 1. Configuration Recorder: Defines which resources to monitor (e.g., SecurityGroups)
# 2. Config Rules: Defines compliance checks to run against resources
# 3. These components are decoupled by design:
#    - Rules without recorded resources will show as NOT_APPLICABLE
#    - Recording resources without rules still tracks configuration history
#    - This allows for flexible implementation and cost optimization
# 4. The Delivery Channel defines where findings and history are sent (S3, SNS)


# AWS Config: Recording vs. Rule Compliance
# Configuration Recording in AWS Config is about creating an inventory and historical record of your AWS resources' configurations. Think of it as a detailed logbook üìñ that answers "What did this resource look like, and when did it change?" Its primary goal is to provide visibility, track changes over time for operational troubleshooting, security analysis, and asset management. It captures the "as-is" state of your resources.
#
# Rule Compliance, on the other hand, is about evaluating whether those recorded configurations meet your specific desired state, security best practices, or regulatory requirements. Rules act as your auditors üßê, answering "Is this resource configured correctly according to our policies?" Their goal is to assess adherence to defined standards and flag non-compliant resources, enabling remediation and governance.
